```

+ This structure presists through the full QAP
    - above you will find the branch titled [Project#1-done](https://github.com/007snoop/SQL-QAP1/tree/project%231-done) and [Problem#2-done](https://github.com/007snoop/SQL-QAP1/tree/problem%232-done). 

+ Each branch has it's own README file.
    - E.g. `Project#1-done` has a different README.md to `Problem#2-done`

+ To run the scripts just clone the branch with the scripts you wish to run.

# Known Issues

+ Branch name;
    - I know, Problem and Project, I messed up, but its just a branch name. Dock marks if needed but it was an honest mistake.
+ .sql Extenions;
    - If your PATH for .sql is not set, it may not run as you want. 

## without PATH set

+ take the .sql files and open them in a plain text editor (doesn't have to be an ide)
+ copy the scripts (outside of `/* */`)
+ paste them into your query engine of your choosing.
